I have so many notifications that the unread notification count becomes noisy 
and useless. My e-mail client does a better job of sorting than the GitHub UI. 
This chrome extension hides it. 

Here's how you do it.

1. Clone this repository into your favourite directory
2. Open Extensions
3. Check "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and find the path to this repository
