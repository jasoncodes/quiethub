# QuietHub 

Stop the noise. QuietHub is an extension for [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) that hides badges and broadcasts
when you're logged in on [GitHub](http://github.com).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your favourite directory
2. Window > Extensions
3. Check "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and find the path to this repository

## Motivation

### Badges

I have so many notifications that the unread notification badge becomes noisy 
and useless. My e-mail client does a better job of threading and sorting than
GitHub's user interface.

### Broadcasts

They're redundant. I'm subscribed to GitHub's blog feed and read new broadcasts 
on my iPad at my convenience. It's frustrating having these broadcasts displayed
prominently on the dashboard when I may have read them.

I :heart: GitHub, but these two things really annoy me.
